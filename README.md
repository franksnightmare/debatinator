# Poor man's debating technologies by not IBM

## Problem
Controversial subjects such as gun control and abortion have many different viewpoints.
In order to make proper decisions it is important to take these viewpoints into account.
Finding the pros and cons of an idea will ideally give all arguments for all sides and so a general overview of all viewpoints.

## State of the Art
IBM's machine goes through many text sources to extract arguments pro and con topics.
One of IBM's previous creations, the jeopardy playing Watson, was recreated by searching wikipedia as a poor man's alternative.

## New Idea
Instead of using IBM's intensive method we will aim to get the same pros and cons by using widely available and structured information on the internet.
This is similar to the poor man's Watson and would show that there are simpler ways of getting the pros and cons of topics.

## Results
???

## Relevance
Tools such as IBM's debating technologies can help many different decision makers in society.
For the poor man that does not have access to this technology, our version may offer some help.
