# debatinator
It's a debate machine or something <- Ignore this

# Websites that we are using
## For more American subjects
Pages from procon.org can have structured pros and cons with bold titles.
Either these pros and cons or maybe soon(tm) condensed arguments from quotes (just the first or last sentence really).

## For European and other subjects
Pages from prosancons.com have nice structured pros and cons.
Procon.org is very focussed on American topics and so Brexit or other more European topics are not represented.

# Poor man's debating technologies by not IBM

## Problem
Controversial subjects such as gun control and abortion have many different viewpoints. In order to make proper decisions it is important to take these viewpoints into account. Finding the pros and cons of an idea will ideally give all arguments for all sides and so a general overview of all viewpoints.

## State of the Art
IBM's machine goes through many text sources to extract arguments pro and con about a topic. One of IBM's previous creations, the jeopardy playing Watson, was recreated in a simpler way. Poor man's Watson gives similar answers simply by searching wikipedia.

## New Idea
Instead of using IBM's intensive method we will aim to get the same pros and cons by using widely available and structured information on the internet. For this we will use the website "procon.org" and, if time allows, also other sources. This is similar to the poor man's Watson and would show that there are simpler ways of getting the pros and cons of topics. Pages from the procon website will be retrieved via a google search.

## Results
The system should be able to give pros and cons for topics that it is asked about. It may not always give correct answers, but it should often be able to identify the topic correctly and find some of the pros and cons. The machine can be asked questions like "I want to know more about X" and the machine will answer with a few arguments pro and con. The machine can then be asked to give more arguments or to be asked something else.

## Relevance
Tools such as IBM's debating technologies can help many different decision makers in society. For the poor man that does not have access to this technology, our version may offer some help.
