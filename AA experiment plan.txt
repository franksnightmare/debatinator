7 Question types:
1 rxfdg
2 ew
3 sfe
4 sfd
5 sdf
6 sdf
7 sdfs

x topics
for x * 7 questions

x result pages p, one for each topic


The experiment
  Go over each question
  do a google search with nltk preprocessing, spacy preprocessing and no preprocessing
  
  get the first y results (probably 10)
  if topic page p is in the list:
     score = y - ranking in the list
  else:
     score = 0
  
  what we want to measure:
    increase and/or decrease in ranking in google of page p with respect to the different preprocessing methods
